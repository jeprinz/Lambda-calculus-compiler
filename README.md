* c/main.c - c program which wraps assembly generated by compiler
* racket/asm.rkt - code parsing and intermediate representations
* racket/compiler.rkt - compiler without any optimizations
* racket/compiler-* - compiler with some optimization depending on*

##How to use:
First run ./compiler-the-compiler, which will compile main.c

Then, to compile a file, open compile*.rkt in drracket, and run e.g.
